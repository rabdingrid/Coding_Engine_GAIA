## Description
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has $$$n$$$ friends, and he wants to have at least $$$2$$$ of them at his party.

The $$$i$$$-th friend's best friend is $$$p_i$$$. All $$$p_i$$$ are distinct, and for every $$$i \in [1, n]$$$, $$$p_i \ne i$$$.

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The $$$i$$$-th friend comes to the party if both the $$$i$$$-th friend and the $$$p_i$$$-th friend receive an invitation (note that the $$$p_i$$$-th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if $$$p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]$$$, and Monocarp sends invitations to the friends $$$[1, 2, 4, 5]$$$, then the friends $$$[2, 4, 5]$$$ will come to the party. The friend $$$1$$$ won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the friend $$$3$$$ won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least $$$2$$$ friends come to the party.

## Input Format
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 50$$$) — the number of friends;
- the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$; $$$p_i \ne i$$$; all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct).

## Output Format
Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.
