# Strange List

## Description
You have given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$ to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be $$$q$$$. If $$$q$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot adds $$$x$$$ copies of the integer $$$\frac{q}{x}$$$ to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if $$$q$$$ is not divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot shuts down.

Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.

## Input Format
The first input line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \leq x \leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot.

The next line contains integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial values in the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output Format
For each test case output one integer — the sum of all elements at the end of the process.
